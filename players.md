# Music players
Most music players tend to achieve the same end result, most of the time coming down solely to preference

If you're looking for suggestions however, I have a few

## Windows

### foobar2000

[Foobar](https://www.foobar2000.org/) is an all around nice and simple music player. To use it, simply downlad it, open it, click on `File` in the top left corner, then `Add Folder`, and add the folder your music is stored in (if it isn't already).\
This entirely works for just playing songs, click on one and it'll play.

If you want some options however, I'll go over those as well.

Randomly playing music:
- Go to `Playback`, then hover over `Order`, and click `Random`. Clicking `Repeat` here is also how you loop songs.

Seperate folders:
- Click on `File`, then `New Playlist`. Then, add the folders you want to keep seperate from the first playlist

## Android

### Musicolet

[Musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) is a feature rich music player for Android.

Download it, open it, then do the following to use it:
- Hit the three dots in the bottom right
- Go to `Song library and tags`
- Go to `Folders to scan`
- Add your music folder

Note that musicolet might accidentally grab random audio files from your device. If it does this, find the folder that the audio is playing from, then add that folder to the excluded list like so:
- Hit the three dots in the bottom right
- Go to `Song library and tags`
- Go to `Excluded folders`
- Hit `Add Folder`
- Add the folder you want to exclude from musicolet's searches

If musicolet doesn't automatically find your files, hit the three dots in the bottom right, then hit `Scan` and `SCAN NOW` in the screen that pops up.

Swiping left and right on the app moves the tabs, the first 3 being the most important.\
The first one is your queue (what's playing next)\
The second one is what's currently playing\
The third one is the files themselves that are being played

If your queue doesn't automatically have your music, you can add it by going to the files screen, clicking on the three dots where it says `x songs in this folder` (x being how many songs you have), then hitting `Play`\
You can add songs manually to play by moving them in the queue screen, or hitting on the three dots next to their name on the files screen, and hitting `Play after current song`\
This simply moves it in queue to be the next song that plays after your current one, it doesn't add any duplicates or anything
